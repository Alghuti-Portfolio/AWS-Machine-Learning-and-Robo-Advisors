# AWS-Machine-Learning-and-Robo-Advisors
Lambda

## Objective 
Develop a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio.

**Step 1**
- Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio.

**Step 2**
- Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

**Step 3**
- Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
